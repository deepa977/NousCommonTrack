Different ways to store data
1.file system
file is defined as a physical entity on the local harddisk of a computer to store data
storing data to file, it can read all the contents from beginning to end or it has to read from start position to end position

sequential access file
random access file

i want age > 25 && age < 50 to be retreived?
can we retrieve specific data like this in file system
we cannot filter and retreive data in a file



2.Network model
multiple computer connected in a n/w was storing data from an application
As the application module increases and many computers are used to store data, then data storage becomes unorganized and data retreival becomes complex


3. DBMS -> Database management system
the data was stored in the form of tables
tables had columns(define what type of data it should contain)
and rows(data)
FOXPRO, FOxbase , dbase
1985 to 1994 
it could not create relationship between tables
there was data redundancy

Course -> cid   cname
           100   Btech
           200   MCA
           300   MBA
           400 Others
Student -> rollno  name cid
            1       Amit 100
            2       Arun 999

   
 RDBMS -> relational database management system
the table maintained relationship as primary key, foreign key constraint
Oracle
MySql
Sql Server
MS Access
PostgreSQL
there are called as RDBMS Application S/w
rdbms application uses a common language called SQL (structured query language)

NO SQL DBMS applications like Bigdata, mongodb, cosmosdb
where data is stored in JSON format


SQL is a common query language used by all the RDBMS Application s/w   
if u known to create query in any one application(sqlserver) , working with oracle , mysql etc will be 95% similar.
Only few changes will be in datatypes
SQL -> divides the querying into 5 sections called
DDL (Data Definition Language) -> creating a new entity in the DB
create, alter, drop 
DML (Data Manipulation Language)-> change the data
insert -> new data
update-> modifying the existing data
delete -> remove the data
truncate->remove the data
DQL (DAta Query Language)
select -> retrieve the data
TCL (Transaction Control Language)
->permission to retreive data or manipulate the data
grant-> give permissions
revoke-> remove the permissions
DCL (Data Control Language)
it is used to save changes of data to the db
save changes -> commit
undo save changes -> rollback

features of Sql Server
sql server is a product of Microsoft
it supports query based and wizard based query execution

sql server comes with 2 types of authentication
windows authentication-> it will take the login credentials of the windows os to authenticate to sql server
sql server authentication->mixed mode authentication
username ->sa
password -> at the time of installation
using sa/password -> it would connect to sql server

it supports 4 system databases
master -> this db is responsible for starting sql server


model-> it will give a common menus for all database that is created in SQL Server



msdb -> this is used to keep track of job scheduling
schedule some work which has to be done automatically
sql server agent in sql server which is licensed with Sql server developer, standard or enterprise edition
this will allow the jobs to be scheduled


tempdb-> is used for storing temporary tables
the content of tempdb will get deleted for every instance of sql server we are connecting

developers can create own database as per project settings

sql server datatypes

tinyint -> byte ->0 to 255
smallint -> short 
int -> int
bigint -> long-> credit card number, debit card number , mobno. aadhar no
double->floating numbers double(9,2) -> 7 will be real part, 2 is for decimal part
eg: 2345670.09

money->decimal-> accurate decimal values
eg: 34349.5345534543

char 
varchar
nvarchar

they can store a single character or bunch of characters
gender char(10)
male****** -> occupy 10 bytes for each data of gender 
female****-> space will be 10 
m*********-> space occupied will be 10
f*********->space occupied will be 10

gender varchar(10)

male -4 character space will be allocated
female -> 6 character space
m->1 character space
f -> 1 character space
variant character

gender nvarchar(10)
nvarchar -> will store even unicode format
features of varchar w.r.t the memory size it occupy plus apart from english it can store data in many language also

text-> pdf , resume.docx 

ntext -> but it supports unicode format

varbinary -> it will store binary data like mp3, mp4 ,images

datetime -> date and time values
timespan -> store time value
bit  -> boolean value true/false
true -> 0
false -> 1


DDL 
Constraints
DML


To work on SQL Server -> database engine
IDE to write and execute the queries -> Management studio

what are the things we can create in a DB
1. Database -> will store DB entity like tables, views, stored procedure, function, triggers , index

2. table -> represent the data as columns and rows

3. view -> picking specific columns from multiple tables and managing everything as a single content is called view

 4.stored procedure, function, triggers -> t- sql programming

5. index -> it will sort data and allows us to retrieve data faster


any thing created in sql server will automatically start with dbo
dbo -> database object
dbo.EMP

sql server is not case senstive
we can refer the table name in upper case, lower or mixed case
oracle requires ; after every query
sql server does not require ;


-constraints in sql server
it will impose rules as how the data in the rows should be defined

--null
enter data or it can be null
if no data is entered in a db table it will not consider as 0 instead it will consider as null
0 != null
null is a special type in database which means nothing
if no constraint is specified for a column then default is null

--not null 
not null-> data has to be entered

 --primary key
unique value + not null
unique means the data should not be repeated

  --identity
auto generate numbers in sql server
identity can be applied for columns having numerical datatype
1 table can contain only one column as identity column
identity +primary key can be given together for a column
identity(identity seed, identity increment)
identity(1,1) -> start with 1 and increment by 1
identity(100,100)->100,200,300.............
identity(10,10)->10,20,30..............

--default
we assign a value during table creation
if no data is entered for that column it will consider the default value

 --unique

unique is similar to primary key.
It will not allow duplicate values
unique + null

little difference between oracle and sql server
in sql server null can be given only once
if we give null again it will consider as duplicate value and it will not accept
In oracle for unique constraint we can give null values multiple times

 --check -> check will validate the data entered
validate range of numerical values,
range of date time values
list of varchar data
age int check(age between 18 AND 60)
doj date check(doj between '09/06/2021' and '12/12/2021')
dept varchar(30) check(dept in('IT','Accounts','HR','Admin'))

--foreign key
it is used to create reference/relationship between 2 tables
Primary key column of TableA will be made as Foreign Key column in TableB


DML

Data Manipulation Language

Insert 
3 ways to insert data
1. insert data for all columns as per the sequence of columns created in the table
2. insert data only for not null columns
3. insert null values for null columns
